# Private Members

In this Odin project, we build an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

The application uses:
- Ruby on Rails 6
- Bootstrap 4
- Custom font via Fontsource
